<hr>

<h3>Assasin's Fate by Robin Hobb</h3>
<p>This is epic fantasy and has proven to be one of my favourite fantasy series in recent times.</p>

<h3>Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Audio Collection</h3>
<p>The original work of Arthur Conan Doyle in audio format narrated by the amazing Stephen Fry. It is entertaining and so well written and delivered.</p>

<h3>The Power of Intention by Wayne Dyer</h3>
<p>This book is in the spirituality genre and intention is something I would like to explore for myself now.</p>
